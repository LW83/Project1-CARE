Welcome to the homepage of CARE, a Dublin based community group passionate about helping the environment, promoting sustainability and eco-friendliness.

## Header & Navigation

- __Hero image__

  - All pages of the site have a consistent header, a key element of which is large and striking image of Ireland which drives the color palette for the entire site and reinforces the focus of the group being an Irish based, environmentally-focused community group. 

  ![Hero Image](./docs/fullheader.png)

- __Logo__

  - The logo sets out both the abbreviated and full name of the group and is complimented by a font awesome icon to denote the environment.
  - The font has a color of whitesmoke to contrast against the color of the hero-image whilst being complimentary to the clouds in the image and links back to the homepage across all pages of the site.

  ![Logo](./docs/logo.png)

  - The logo is fully responsive and wraps as screen widths reduce. 

  ![Logo Tablet](./docs/logoandnavtablet.png)

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Events and Tips pages and is replicated in design and functionality across each page to allow for consistency, easy navigation and good UX.
  - This has been floated to the right of the page to align with the top of the CARE logo. 
  - The navigation links are all in whitesmoke to contrast against the color of the hero-image whilst being complimentary to the clouds in the image. The below image shows the user's current page highlighted in blue with a white border.
  - When hovered over, the links are highlighted in a lighter shade of blue to provide feedback to the user and again utilising colors from the hero-image. 
  - When visited, the links change to a shade of green again to replicate colors from the hero image and to provide feedback to the user. 
  ![Nav Bar](./docs/navbar.png)
  - An active class has also been implemented to highlight to the user the current page being viewed. 
  - The navigation bar is fully responsive, for smaller screens, the bar drops below the logo retaining its place on the right side of the screen so as not to compete for space with the logo. In addition the font-color remains white smoke to ensure sufficient contrast with the hero-image given the new placement.

- __Favicon__

  -  A favicon has been added to show up in the title of the page and is consistent with the icon used in the logo itself.

  - __The Footer__ 

  - Similar to the header, all pages of the site have a consistent footer which has two key elements being the option to subscribe to the group's newsletter and links to the group's social media pages. 
  - Again the styling of the footer is driven by the color scheme coming from the hero-image. 
  - The newsletter subscribe button again has a hover feature to provide feedback to the user and when submitted takes the user to a thank you page. 
  - Social media links for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube are included and all open links to the homepages of these sites in a new tab. This is for demonstration purposes only and no social media pages have been created. 
  - All social media links are represented by Font Awesome icons. 
  - Finally, the footer includes a note regarding copyright and a call-out that the site is fictional in nature. 

- __About Section__

  - The About section on the site is focused on setting out for the user who the group are, what they do and why they do it. 
  - Boxes and font awesome icons have been added to distinguish these sections.
  - This page has been kept deliberately lighter on content so as not to overwhelm a potential new user.
