                <br>
                <p> We are a group of volunteers based in Dublin who believe in taking small (or sometimes big!) steps to help maintain our environment, live in a more sustainable manner and lower our environmental footprint. Society is becoming increasingly aware of the impact that environmental considerations such as climate change and plastic pollution are having and we believe that collectively we can make a contribution to changing this trend. </p>
            </div>
<!--Sets out What the group do and aim to achieve-->
            <div class="about-box">
                <h2> <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle"></i> What We Do <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle"></i> </h2>
                <br>
                <p> Each member or volunteer is unique in this regard from the personal steps they choose to take in their own day to day lives (check out our <a href="tips.html">Tips</a> page!) or their involvement in organising or participating in bigger events such as community clean-ups.
                            We believe that each person can take the steps that they feel comfortable with as every little bit helps towards the bigger goal of protecting our earth, oceans, animals and ecosystems for future generations. </p>

                <p>In summary, because we C.A.R.E. and because ultimately there is no Planet B! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We want to try and do our bit to leave the world and the envvironment in as good if not better place for the next generation to enjoy and hopefully protect. If you feel passionate about this too, please check out our Tips and Events sections for ideas on how you can get involved.</p>
